			<p>Gun violence has been an issue that has plagued the American school system for years. As of today, there have been 323 school shootings in the United States this year alone. But for that same amount of time, there has been little action on tightening gun laws to protect children and teachers in schools. But there is a way that people at home can stop the violence occurring in our schools.
		The answer is locking your firearms up and keeping them in a safe, to keep your kids safe.
		Gun safety is one of the best ways to keep avoidable shooting incidents from happening. While gun purchases have spiked in recent years, gun safety numbers haven’t. Millions of Americans still do not take the necessary precautions to keep their firearms safely stored in the home, and for a small few of them, it is costing people’s lives.
	According to a study done by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, more than half of all gun owners in the United States leave their firearms unlocked and easily accessible. In 2021, that meant of the 7,512,175 gun owners across the US, around 4 million of them left their guns unlocked. However, the University of Michigan’s Institute of Firearm Injury Prevention took it a step forward and focused on a smaller target audience. The university contacted around 3,000 gun owners with teens and children about how they store their firearms. At the end of the survey, “it is estimated that one-third of all households with children up to age 18 contain at least one firearm.” </p>

			<h3>Crunching the Numbers</h3>
			<p>But when the two studies are put together, that is when the true colors of gun safety begin to show. In the Johns Hopkins study it was found that over half of all gun owners leave their firearms unlocked. So based on the total number of gun owners in 2021 it can be estimated that around four million Americans didn’t safely store their guns. And according to the University of Michigan, one-third of gun-owning households with teens contain at least one firearm. So the math says that around 1.3 million households in 2021 did not safely store their firearm/firearms in their homes with young children or teens. That means in 2021, around 1.3 million teens had access to a gun that could have or potentially was used in a school shooting.
	Since the Columbine High School Shooting in 1999, there have been an estimated 422 school shootings. These events have left Americans dead or injured and families without their loved ones. The Washington Post compiled a database in 2018 with information about as many school shootings as they could. That data was then updated throughout the years. Although some pieces of data are not complete, they still tell a shocking story.	
Around 105 of the 422 school shooting incidents recorded contained information on where the shooter acquired the firearm used in the shooting according to the Post’s findings. After sifting through and organizing them all, it was concluded that 54 of the 105 incidents used a weapon that was taken from a family member. That comes out to over half of all incidents. That means around half of the school shootings could have been preventable if the gun owner safely locked away their firearms or firearms.</p>

			<h3>Keep the Guns in a Safe</h3>
			<p>Although there has not been much effort from lawmakers to stop future school shootings, American gun owners have that ability. Locking your guns up safely and away from teens can prevent school shootings and other firearm violence from ever happening.
There are many organizations that can help gun owners with that exact task. One in particular is the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The NSSF runs a program called Project Childsafe, an education program meant to educate both gun owners and children about gun safety and storage in the home. The program allows people access to gun safety kits and cable locks for their firearms. According to the company website, “To date more than 40 million of these locks have been distributed, in addition to the more than 70 million free gun locks manufacturers have distributed with their products over the past 25 years”.
The NSSF has multiple ways to keep your guns safe in the home, but one of them made the most sense.
“Store your firearms in a locked cabinet, safe, gun vault, or storage case when not in use, ensuring they are in a location inaccessible by children and cannot be handled by anyone without your permission.” the company said.
School shootings have been a plague on this nation for years. And unfortunately, there has been little done by those who can create long-lasting change to keep our schools and our children safe. But if this article taught you the reader anything, then you know that school shootings are preventable. It starts with you. Keep your guns in a safe to keep the children safe. </p>
